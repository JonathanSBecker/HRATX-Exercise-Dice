# HRATX-Exercise-Dice
We used to roll some neon dice at HR ATX, but I decided to make a script so we could get more variety.

## How to run
Type <npm run exercise> in terminal OR open the HTML file

## Words of Warning
There's one script (npm run start) that currently only works on Linux. Once I've completed enough I'll implement easier use for Mac and Windows users, or deploy so that you don't have to download anyting.

## Coming Soon (to a theater near you)
A UI
Easier use
